# Wheather-App
This is my first JSON project using  to fatch the Weather data and make this for learning purpose.... :)

<br>
### How it works?
1. The user needs to enter a city name in the search bar and click on the "Get
weather" button.
2. Then, an API call will be made with the entered city name as parameter.
3. If there's any error during this process (like if the city doesn't exist
or the server is down), then an alert message will show up saying something went wrong.
4. Otherwise, the weather information of that specific city will be displayed below the search bar. It
includes the temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc., along with an icon representing the current
weather condition.
5. There are also buttons at the bottom of the page for changing between Celsius and F
ahrenheit units or showing/hiding more details about the weather. When these buttons are clicked,
the appropriate action will take place.</s>
